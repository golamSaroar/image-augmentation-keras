## Image Data Augmentation with Keras

Data augmentation is a technique used to create more examples, artiﬁcially, from an existing dataset. This is useful if your dataset is small and you want to increase the number of examples. This can often solve over-fitting so that your model generalizes well after training. For images, a variety of augmentation can be applied to increase the number of examples.

The goal of this project is to apply image data augmentation in Keras using the [ImageDataGenerator](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/image/ImageDataGenerator) class from Keras’ image preprocessing package. I have explored a variety of options available in this class for data augmentation and data normalization.
